# C# Text RPG (Early Concept)

This is a very early-stage, text-based RPG built in C# as a learning project.  
Right now, the focus is on understanding basic game loops, player input handling, and structuring console-based interactions.

The game is centered around a simple Rock–Paper–Scissors combat system against a dummy enemy. Most of the work so far has been on getting the flow of menus, choices, and narration working cleanly before adding real mechanics.

## Current Status
Early conceptual / learning stage.  
Not fully playable yet.

## What This Project Is For
- Practicing C# fundamentals
- Learning how to structure a basic game loop
- Experimenting with simple combat logic
- Getting comfortable with Git and GitHub workflows

## How to Run
This is a .NET console application.  
Open the project in Visual Studio or VS Code and run it as a standard C# console app.

This project was meant to be intentionally small and scoped as a learning exercise.

In practice, the project grew too large in scope to maintain, dismantling its core features as a result.
